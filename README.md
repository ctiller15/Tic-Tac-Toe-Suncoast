# Tic Tac Toe

How to work on this repo:

1: first create a new branch on github. (here)

2: on your own machine, in your desired directory, `git pull` this repository.

3: on your own machine, in your repository, run `git checkout -b branchName  origin/branchName`

4: Work in your branch, complete your changes.

5: `git add`

6: `git commit`

7: `git push`

8: On github, create a new pull request. You want the base branch to be master, and the other branch to be your branch.

9: On the pull request, leave a message detailing your changes.

10: Once your pull request is completed, you may delete your branch.

It's best to think of each branch as a specific 'feature', instead of an individual history that you are working with.

* It appears that if you want to keep working with your branch, you need to delete and recreate it on github.
